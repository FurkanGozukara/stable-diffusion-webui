Latest installer zip file : https://www.patreon.com/posts/86307255

*   I have forked the official and latest version of Automatic1111 : [https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
    *   ADetailer : [https://github.com/Bing-su/adetailer](https://github.com/Bing-su/adetailer)
    *   ControlNet : [https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet)
    *   Installation process is now way faster than before
*   Automatic1111 is very old but there is still people demanding and using it so here it is
    *   But I would recommend still up-to-date developed NEO
        *   Classic : [https://www.patreon.com/posts/138680643](https://www.patreon.com/posts/138680643)
        *   Forge Web UI NEO : [https://www.patreon.com/posts/138694680](https://www.patreon.com/posts/138694680)
*   Then modified all of them with minimal amount to make them work with latest GPUs and xFormers
    *   Now our installer and apps supports starting from RTX 1000 series to RTX 5000 series including cloud GPUs like H100, B200, RTX PRO 6000 etc
    *   Making them work with newest libraries were so hard but now we are using Torch 2.8, CUDA 12.9, xFormers 0.33
*   The installer will install ADetailer and ControlNet by default but you have to download ControlNet models manually or run Windows_Optional_Download_ControlNet_Models.bat file after install
*   Default Sampler set to UniPc and default steps count set to 40
*   Tested on RTX 5090 and works perfect and amazingly fast with xFormers
*   The app will start with xFormers by default both on Linux (MassedCompute and RunPod) and Windows
    *   On MassedCompute and RunPod it will also auto start with Gradio live share to access from your computer
*   Put Stable Diffusion models into stable-diffusion-webui\models\Stable-diffusion
*   ControlNet models into stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\sd-webui-controlnet\models
*   The app won't download any model like before when you first time start and you can start the app without loading any model - this was not possible before i fixed both
